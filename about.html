            <h3>Early Life</h3>
            <p>
                Jimbo Andrew Bob grew up in Australia in a small house with his mother and father. Since a young age
                Jimbo had a love for the animals that sometimes scared other people. Both of his parents worked with
                animals and constantly kept him around them. This was something that his mother and father always had
                noticed and they knew he would one day grow up to work with these kinds of animals. At the age of seven
                Jimbo lost his mother, which had a very big impact on his life. From here his form of coping was
                spending time with animals which made his love for them only grow stronger.
            </p>

            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <p>
                Jimbo has worked with animals from all over the world. He spent his early life in Australia working with
                the local animals that his mother and father had. When he was in his teens he began working for a zoo
                nearby his home town where he began to learn much more about all of the new animals he never had access 
                to. Jimbo spent five years working here and in that time he only fell more in love with what he was
                doing. The next four years he would spend at a college getting a degree. After graduation he became an
                assistant to an exotic animals veterinarian. Jimbo then stayed in that field for another ten years
                where his knowledge for the animals would grow greatly. After approximately twenty years of working
                with these animals Jimbo decided that he wanted to work in the wild with the animals that could fully
                be themselves. This decision was made because he felt the animals of Australia were the most beautiful
                when they were in their natural environment.
            </p>

            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>
                Jimbo studied at the Harvard University for four years on a full ride where he recieved his bachelors
                in Zoology. Jimbo earned a 3.79 GPA in his time there.
